// Now let's introduce a variable, a place to put a value, a.k.a. the bucket

// 'Hello World' is a value of the type "string", meaning a sequence of letters,
// a text. We place it in the variable with the name "myMessage", so we can call
// it later and it will give us its content. The equal sign "=" is the assignment
// operator, symbolically standing for the action of putting the value into the
// bucket:
let myMessage = 'Hello again, old world!';

// Now we can refer to this variable by its name and print its content.
console.log(myMessage);
